    Git and GitHub are essential tools for version control and collaborative software development. Here's a breakdown of basic Git commands, keeping in mind the distinction that Git is the version control system, and GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git.

<!-- Core Git Commands:

git init:
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It's the first step in tracking changes to your project.
git clone <repository_url>:
This command creates a local copy of a remote repository. You'll use this to download projects from GitHub.
git status:
This command displays the status of your working directory, showing which files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.
git add <file_name> or git add .:
This command stages changes for a commit. git add <file_name> adds a specific file, and git add . adds all changes in the current directory.
git commit -m "commit message":
This command saves the staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message. The commit message should explain the changes you've made.
git push origin <branch_name>:
This command uploads your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
git pull origin <branch_name>:
This command downloads changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
git branch:
This command lists all the branches in your local repository.
git branch <branch_name>:
This command creates a new branch.
git checkout <branch_name>:
This command switches to the specified branch.
git merge <branch_name>:
This command merges the specified branch into the current branch.
git log:
This command shows a log of the commits made to the repository.
GitHub-Related Concepts:

Repositories:
GitHub repositories are where your project's files and version history are stored.
Branches:
Branches allow you to work on different versions of your project without affecting the main codebase.
Commits:
Commits are snapshots of your project's changes.
Pull Requests:
Pull requests are a way to propose changes to a repository. They allow for code review and collaboration.
Forking:
Forking creates a personal copy of another user's repository. -->
